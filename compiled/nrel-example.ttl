The Property class is the parent of all variations of a property, which are:
ActuatableProperty - parent of subclass of properties that can be modified by user or machine outside of the model (typically command);
ObservableProperty - parent of subclass of properties that can not be modified by user or machine outside of the model (typically measures);
EnumerableProperty - parent of subclass of properties defined by EnumerationKind;
QuantifiableProperty - parent of subclass of properties defined by numerical values.

And their different associations :
QuantifiableActuatableProperty,
QuantifiableObservableProperty,
EnumeratedObservableProperty,
EnumeratedActuatableProperty.

A QuantifiableProperty (or subClass thereof) must always be associated with a Unit and a QuantityKind, either explicitly from the Property, or through the associated Value. If the Unit is defined, the SHACL reasoner (if invoked) will figure out and assert the QuantityKind (the most general version).

Enumerable properties must be associated with an EnumerationKind.

A ConnectionPoint is an abstract modeling construct used to represent the fact that one connectable thing can be connected to another connectable thing using a Connection. It is the abstract representation of the flange, wire terminal, or other physical feature where a connection is made. Equipment, DomainSpaces and Junctions can have one or more ConnectionPoints (see `s223:Connectable`).

A ConnectionPoint is constrained to relate to a specific medium such as air, water, or electricity which determines what other things can be connected to it. For example, constraining a ConnectionPoint to be for air means it cannot be used for an electrical connection.

A ConnectionPoint belongs to exactly one connectable thing (see `s222:Connectable').

ConnectionPoints are represented graphically in this standard by a triangle with the point indicating a direction of flow, or a diamond in the case of a bidirectional flow as shown in Figure 6-1.
