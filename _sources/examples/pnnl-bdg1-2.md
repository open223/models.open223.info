# PNNL Example Building 1 Model 2

Example Building 1 is a simplistic, reference tiny office building consisting of a single story with 5 rooms spanning 5 space types.

This reference building was developed for and first described in the journal article ["Metadata Schemas and Ontologies for Building Energy Applications: A Critical Review and Use Case Analysis"](https://doi.org/10.3390/en14072024).

Example Building 1 Model 2 is provided by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. 
See [NIST Example Building 1 Model 1](../nist-bdg1-1.md) for a different modeling approach for the same building.

## Contents

This model contains a representation of the building architecture and electrical/lighting system.

In addition to the s223 ontology, the model uses the [Real Estate Core ontology](https://dev.realestatecore.io/ontology/) to describe space types. The Real Estate Core ontology is extended by defining 2 subclasses for rec:Office.
``` ttl
recx:OpenOffice rdfs:subClassOf rec:Office;
  rdfs:label "Open Office".
recx:PrivateOffice rdfs:subClassOf rec:Office;
  rdfs:label "Private Office".
```

## Source

The model was created from source data consisting of a building information model (BIM) created using [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com/) Revit, and exported via a [Speckle](https://speckle.systems/) interface.

Model instance data have a prefix that is resolvable to a Speckle URL.
``` ttl
@prefix bdg1: <http://speckle.xyz/streams/59e5e3c6a8/objects/>
```

For example, the following luminaire resolves to http://speckle.xyz/streams/59e5e3c6a8/objects/e2164e3d14db5fcb6915a4a2c8474579 :
``` ttl
bdg1:e2164e3d14db5fcb6915a4a2c8474579 a s223:Luminaire
```

## Load and Validate Model

This code uses the [BuildingMOTIF](https://github.com/NREL/BuildingMOTIF) library to load the 223P ontology and the model file into a temporary in-memory instance.
It then validates the model against the ontology. If the model is invalid, it will print the validation report.

To run this code, you need to have Java installed on your system. If you do not have Java installed, you can remove the `shacl_engine='topquadrant'` parameter from the `BuildingMOTIF` constructor.
Be warned that without the `shacl_engine='topquadrant'` parameter, the validation process will be slower.

````{note} BuildingMOTIF installation
:class: dropdown
To install the `buildingmotif` library, you can use the following command:

```shell
pip install 'buildingmotif[topquadrant] @ git+https://github.com/NREL/buildingmotif.git@develop'
```

If you do not have Java installed, you can use the following command to install the library:

```shell
pip install 'buildingmotif @ git+https://github.com/NREL/buildingmotif.git@develop'
```
````


```{code-cell} python3
from buildingmotif import BuildingMOTIF
from buildingmotif.dataclasses import Library, Model
import logging

# Create a BuildingMOTIF object. If you do not have Java installed, remove the "shacl_engine" parameter
bm = BuildingMOTIF('sqlite://', shacl_engine='topquadrant', log_level=logging.ERROR)

# load 223P library. We will load a recent copy from the models.open223.info
# git repository; later, we will load this from the location of the actual standard
s223 = Library.load(ontology_graph="https://github.com/open223/models.open223.info/raw/main/ontologies/223p.ttl")

# load the model into the BuildingMOTIF instance
model = Model.create("urn:pnnl-bdg1-2")
model.graph.parse("https://models.open223.info/pnnl-bdg1-2.ttl")

# validate the model against 223P ontology
ctx = model.validate([s223.get_shape_collection()], error_on_missing_imports=False)

# print the validation result
print(f"Model is valid: {ctx.valid}")

# if the model is invalid, print the validation report
if not ctx.valid:
    print(ctx.report_string[:1000]) # first 1000 characters of the report

# BuildingMOTIF can also interpret the report to provide recommendations on fixes
for focus_node, diffs in ctx.get_reasons_with_severity("Violation").items():
    if len(diffs) == 0:
        continue
    print(focus_node)
    for diff in diffs:
        print("  - " + diff.reason())

```
