# PNNL Example Building 1 Model 2

Example Building 1 is a simplistic, reference tiny office building consisting of a single story with 5 rooms spanning 5 space types.

This reference building was developed for and first described in the journal article ["Metadata Schemas and Ontologies for Building Energy Applications: A Critical Review and Use Case Analysis"](https://doi.org/10.3390/en14072024).

Example Building 1 Model 2 is provided by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. 
See [NIST Example Building 1 Model 1](../nist-bdg1-1.md) for a different modeling approach for the same building.

## Contents

This model contains a representation of the building architecture and electrical/lighting system.

In addition to the s223 ontology, the model uses the [Real Estate Core ontology](https://dev.realestatecore.io/ontology/) to describe space types. The Real Estate Core ontology is extended by defining 2 subclasses for rec:Office.
``` ttl
recx:OpenOffice rdfs:subClassOf rec:Office;
  rdfs:label "Open Office".
recx:PrivateOffice rdfs:subClassOf rec:Office;
  rdfs:label "Private Office".
```

## Source

The model was created from source data consisting of a building information model (BIM) created using [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com/) Revit, and exported via a [Speckle](https://speckle.systems/) interface.

Model instance data have a prefix that is resolvable to a Speckle URL.
``` ttl
@prefix bdg1: <http://speckle.xyz/streams/59e5e3c6a8/objects/>
```

For example, the following luminaire resolves to http://speckle.xyz/streams/59e5e3c6a8/objects/e2164e3d14db5fcb6915a4a2c8474579 :
``` ttl
bdg1:e2164e3d14db5fcb6915a4a2c8474579 a s223:Luminaire
```
