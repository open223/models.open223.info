# LBNL Example Building 3 Model 1

Example Building 3 is a real-world medium-sized office building.
It is approximately 67,000 square feet in size, contains 2 floors, 27 space types, and 469 rooms. Labels have been anonymized, and are not interpretable.
It uses an underfloor air distribution system with fan-powered terminal reheat coils for perimeter zones. Four roof-top units with VAV are located on the roof. 
The lighting system  primariliy uses fluorescent luminaires and zone-based lighting controllers that communicate with user interface devices and wireless gatetways over DALI networks. The gateways collect occupancy and light sensor data over an ISM-band wireless network.

Example Building 3 Model 1 is provided by LBNL.
See [PNNL Example Building 3 model 2](../pnnl-bdg3-2.md) for a different modeling approach for the same building.
