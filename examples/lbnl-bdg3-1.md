# LBNL Example Building 3 Model 1

Example Building 3 is a real-world medium-sized office building.
It is approximately 67,000 square feet in size, contains 2 floors, 27 space types, and 469 rooms. Labels have been anonymized, and are not interpretable.
It uses an underfloor air distribution system with fan-powered terminal reheat coils for perimeter zones. Four roof-top units with VAV are located on the roof. 
The lighting system  primariliy uses fluorescent luminaires and zone-based lighting controllers that communicate with user interface devices and wireless gatetways over DALI networks. The gateways collect occupancy and light sensor data over an ISM-band wireless network.

Example Building 3 Model 1 is provided by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
See [PNNL Example Building 3 model 2](pnnl-bdg3-2.md) for a different modeling approach for the same building.

<summary>What are these files?</summary>

- **Turtle file (original)**: This is the original source Turtle file that was provided to `models.open223.info`, usually as the output of some model creation tool.
- **Turtle file (compiled)**: This is the original Turtle file with all inferred relationships and values added through SHACL inference against the 223P ontology and other dependencies. **You should use this file for any further processing.** It does not contain any of the ontologies.
- **Turtle file (with all imports)**: This is the compiled Turtle file with all imports included in the file (223P ontology, QUDT ontology, and others). This is helpful when you do not want to deal with downloading and managing ontology dependencies. It is also much larger than the compiled file.
- **JSON-LD file (original)**: This is the original Turtle file converted to the JSON-LD format.

[Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/) is a syntax for RDF (Resource Description Framework) that is easy to read and write. It is a popular format for representing linked data. Parsers and serializers
are available in many programming languages. [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org) is a JSON-based format for linked data that is easy to use with JavaScript and other web technologies.
