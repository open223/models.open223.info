# PNNL Example Building 1 Model 2

Example Building 1 is a simplistic, reference tiny office building consisting of a single story with 5 rooms spanning 5 space types.

This reference building was developed for and first described in the journal article ["Metadata Schemas and Ontologies for Building Energy Applications: A Critical Review and Use Case Analysis"](https://doi.org/10.3390/en14072024).

Example Building 1 Model 2 is provided by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. 
See [NIST Example Building 1 Model 1](nist-bdg1-1.md) for a different modeling approach for the same building.

## Contents

This model contains a representation of the building architecture and electrical/lighting system.

In addition to the s223 ontology, the model uses the [Real Estate Core ontology](https://dev.realestatecore.io/ontology/) to describe space types. The Real Estate Core ontology is extended by defining 2 subclasses for rec:Office.
``` ttl
recx:OpenOffice rdfs:subClassOf rec:Office;
  rdfs:label "Open Office".
recx:PrivateOffice rdfs:subClassOf rec:Office;
  rdfs:label "Private Office".
```

## Source

The model was created from source data consisting of a building information model (BIM) created using [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com/) Revit, and exported via a [Speckle](https://speckle.systems/) interface.

Model instance data have a prefix that is resolvable to a Speckle URL.
``` ttl
@prefix bdg1: <http://speckle.xyz/streams/59e5e3c6a8/objects/>
```

For example, the following luminaire resolves to http://speckle.xyz/streams/59e5e3c6a8/objects/e2164e3d14db5fcb6915a4a2c8474579 :
``` ttl
bdg1:e2164e3d14db5fcb6915a4a2c8474579 a s223:Luminaire
```

<summary>What are these files?</summary>

- **Turtle file (original)**: This is the original source Turtle file that was provided to `models.open223.info`, usually as the output of some model creation tool.
- **Turtle file (compiled)**: This is the original Turtle file with all inferred relationships and values added through SHACL inference against the 223P ontology and other dependencies. **You should use this file for any further processing.** It does not contain any of the ontologies.
- **Turtle file (with all imports)**: This is the compiled Turtle file with all imports included in the file (223P ontology, QUDT ontology, and others). This is helpful when you do not want to deal with downloading and managing ontology dependencies. It is also much larger than the compiled file.
- **JSON-LD file (original)**: This is the original Turtle file converted to the JSON-LD format.

[Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/) is a syntax for RDF (Resource Description Framework) that is easy to read and write. It is a popular format for representing linked data. Parsers and serializers
are available in many programming languages. [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org) is a JSON-based format for linked data that is easy to use with JavaScript and other web technologies.
